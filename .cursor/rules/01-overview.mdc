# Integrated Photonics BEM Project Overview

This is a Python package that simulates electrostatics for integrated photonic devices and ion traps using the boundary element method (BEM).

## Key Components
- **bem/**: Core implementation of the BEM simulation framework
- **examples/**: Example simulations and workflows
- **fastlap/**: Wraps the FastLap BEM and FMM implementation 
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
- **triangle/**: Triangulation libraries and tools

## Main Workflow
1. Create a model in STL format
2. Configure a BEM simulation job 
3. Run the BEM electrostatics simulation
4. Analyze the results (visualization, post-processing)
