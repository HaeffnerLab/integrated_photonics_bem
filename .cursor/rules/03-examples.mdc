# Examples and Simulations

The `examples/` directory contains various simulation examples demonstrating the use of the BEM package.

## Key Examples
- [examples/SimpleTrap/SimpleTrap.ipynb](mdc:examples/SimpleTrap/SimpleTrap.ipynb): Basic example showing the complete workflow for a simple ion trap
- [examples/Integrated_photonics/](mdc:examples/Integrated_photonics/): Simulations for integrated photonics devices

## Example Structure
Each example typically includes:
1. A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) with the complete workflow
2. STL files for the device geometry
3. Python scripts for running simulations
4. VTK files for visualization of results
5. Batch job scripts for running on HPC (e.g., saviojob.sh)

## Running Examples
Examples can be run locally or on a high-performance computing cluster like Berkeley's Savio.
