If the total RAM requested exceeds what your computer has, <b>you're gonna have a bad time</b>. One of two things will likely happen- first is that your computer will try to start using 'swap space' which is using disk memory as RAM which will slow down the computation significantly- this is not obvious unless you are looking at the resources being used by your computer (look for normal memory used and swap memory used on system monitor).
